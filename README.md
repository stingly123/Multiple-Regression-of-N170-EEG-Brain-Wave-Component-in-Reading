# stingly123-Multiple-Regression-of-N170-EEG-Brain-Wave-Component-in-Reading-R-Programming-
This project introduces multiple regression models for predicting the N170 component of EEG brain waves for students with reading disabilities as well as students who are typically developing readers. Factors that are accounted for include school intervention and various reading assessment scores. It is a personal project completed for an R programming class at Columbia University.
